In 2016, to celebrate Star Trek's 50th anniversary [Holly Amos](https://twitter.com/hollyamos22) rewatched all 726 Star Trek episodes and 13 movies in one year. 

She knows quite a lot about Star Trek since she works for CBS in their Star Trek archive. This made her live tweets of each episode with different factoids/behind-the-scenes information pretty interesting and made me want to re-watch the series myself. 

She archived her tweets, but the Google Spreadsheet was ugly and a little hard to read so I did this because I was bored.

I'm pretty much done with this since I lost interest quickly. It doesn't look pretty but is easier to navigate then the spreadsheet was.

After cloning repo, run:

``` composer install ```

Just load up a php server locally:

``` php -S localhost:8000 ```

visit localhost:8000 to view tweets.
