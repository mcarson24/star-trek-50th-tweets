Professional Trekspert [Holly Amos](https://twitter.com/hollyamos22) rewatched all 726 Star Trek episodes and 13 movies in 2016. 

Her live tweets of each episode included different factoids/behind-the-scenes information that are pretty interesting and made me want to re-watch the series myself. 

She archived her tweets, but the Google Spreadsheet was ugly and a little hard to read so I did this because I was bored.

I'm pretty much done with this since I lost interest quickly. It doesn't look pretty, but is easier to navigate then the spreadsheet was.
